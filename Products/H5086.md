The H5086 is much like the H5080, but adds the ability to monitor power usage
The protocol is very similar to the H5080, but there are minor differences
Check the `Products/H5080` folder for a set of example scripts to get you started communicating with the device.

## Communication protocol

The protocol is identical to the H5080, using the same Characteristics.

## Authentication
Authentication is the same as the H5086

## On/Off state
You can inspect the state of the smart plug in 2 ways:
* Connection-less
    * This is a far cheaper way to obtain the state as it does not rely on you setting up an actual bluetooth connection
    * The device will send the current on/off state as part of the advertisement data
* Connection-based
    * Once you establish a connection, the device will stop broadcasting its advertisement data so in order to read the latest state you will need to use the command/response protocol to check this.

**Connection-less**
From the advertisement data, inspect the `manufacturer data` field. The last byte in that data array will be a boolean flag describing the current state (`0x00` for off, `0x01` for on).

**Connection-based**
Send an AA01 packet and wait for an AA01 response. The first byte in the payload will be a boolean flag with the current state.

## Packets

### Get device on/off state (AA01)
```
Send: aa01 0000000000000000000000000000000000 ab
Recv: aa01 0100000000000000000000000000000000 aa (if on)
      aa01 0000000000000000000000000000000000 ab (if off)
```

## Get device power measurement (AA00)
```
Send: aa00 0000000000000000000000000000000000 aa
Recv: ee19 00198b 000026 2f3d 0091 004465 64 000000 85
           ^^^^^^----------------------------- time powered on in seconds
                  ^^^^^^---------------------- accumulated power (measured in 1/10 of a Wh)
                         ^^^^----------------- Voltage (in 1/100 of a Volt)
                              ^^^^------------ Current (in 1/100 of an Amp)
                                   ^^^^^^----- Power (in 1/100 of a Watt)
                                          ^^-- Power Factor (in %)
```
### Get device firmware version (AA06, AA20, AA21)
There seem to be multiple packet identifiers that return the firmware version. Not sure what their purpose is, maybe it's some backwards compatibility thing 
```
Send: aa06 0000000000000000000000000000000000 ac
Recv: aa06 312e30302e323100000000000000000000 9e
            1 . 0 0 . 2 1
```


### Get device hardware version (AA07)
```
Send: aa07 0300000000000000000000000000000000 ae
Recv: aa07 03312e30322e3030000000000000000000 9d
              1 . 0 2 . 0 0
```


### Get authentication key (AAB1)
```
Send: aab1 0000000000000000000000000000000000 1b
Recv: 
      aab1 00 687ea542cc1d267e0000000000000000 63 (invalid key)
      aab1 01 0db6be06253334300000000000000000    (valid key)
```
To determine if the response has a valid or invalid key you must inspect the first byte of the payload. If it's 0x01 then the response has a valid key.

The authentication key will be in the payload and starts with the second byte in the payload. In the example above, `0db6be06253334300000000000000000` is the valid key.


### Authentication current connection (33B2)
```
Send: 33b2 0db6be0625333430000000000000000000 97
Recv: 33b2 0000000000000000000000000000000000 81 (if key is correct)
```
The send message contains the authentication key in the payload section. If the key is less than the expected size of payload (17 bytes) then you should pad it with 0x00 at the end.

If the authentication key is incorrect, there will be no response received from the device. 

### Set the on/off state (3301)
```
Turn On
Send: 3301 0100000000000000000000000000000000 33
Recv: 3301 0000000000000000000000000000000000 32

Turn Off
Send: 3301 0000000000000000000000000000000000 32
Recv: 3301 0000000000000000000000000000000000 32
```
You must go throuogh the authentication flow before you send any of these on/off messages. Otherwise, you will not receive a response if you send a 3301 message.

### Control indicator light
```
Send: 3316 01 00 00 17 3b 01 0000000000000000000000 09
           ^^ --------------- Disable state indicator light (1: Enabled, 0: Disabled)

                          ^^- Use timer for indicator ligt (1: Yes, 0: No)
Recv: 3316 0000000000000000000000000000000000 25
```

### Lock physical button
```
Send: 331f 0201000000000000000000000000000000 2f
             ^^ - 1: Button is locked, 0: button is unlocked
Recv: 331f 0000000000000000000000000000000000 2c
```

## Other messages
There is more functionality of H5080 device that hasn't been mapped yet. The device is capable of maintaining its own schedule to turn on or off and it's able to have auto-on and auto-off features after a timer expires.
There are probably more messages to read and write this configuration, as well as possibly synchronizing the time so that the schedule could be applied.
